My primary research interest is the development of reproducible and reliable data analysis tools, with a specific focus on problems in neuroscience. My graduate research has focused on two major projects along these themes:  

<b>A Cloud Computing Platform for Reproducible Data Analysis.</b> I am the lead researcher and developer for Neuroscience Cloud Analysis As A Service (NeuroCAAS), a computing platform that removes the burden of computing infrastructure from neuroscience researchers as they use and develop novel data analysis tools. Learn more about the project <a href='neurocaas.org'>here</a>.  

<b>The Benefits and Limitations of Neural Network Ensembles.</b> Ensembling is a popular benchmark method to improve the performance of deep neural networks. My work on these "deep ensembles" studies more recent claims that ensembling also improves the reliability of neural network predictions, and investigates the proposed mechanisms behind their success.  

Beyond research, I am an avid rock climber (primarily bouldering) and cellist (primarily chamber music).
